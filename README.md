# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™ Learn Swift the hard way quickly
*For experienced programmers.*

You probably worked with languages like C in the past and use one of mainstream languages on a daily basis. So why not learn Swift? Here is a list of resources I used (and still use) to learn Swift.  

  1. **Video:** [Intro to Objective-C.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxY9ndyWPIE) A quick 30-minutes long preview of Obj-C. Dense, from basic (*classes, methods*) to more advanced topics (*prototypes, categories*).
  2. [Programming with Objective-C guide.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH1-SW1) Skim to recap core concepts of the language.
  3. [Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000011-SW1) Explains how memory model works in Obj-C runtime. Good explanation of how ref counting and retention work. 
  4. **Video:** [WWDC: Getting Started with Swift.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/404/) An overview of the language filled with nice code examples.
  5. **Interactive Playground:** [A Swift Tour.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH2-ID1)
  6. ... *work in progress, still learning it*
